## About the project

This application is a simple calendar app that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app:

- Displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

- Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

- Color-codes each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

- Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

- Saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

- Persists events between refreshes of a page.
